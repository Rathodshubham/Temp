1)write a shell script to check numbers from 200 to 300 is divisible by 7 and 13


2)print pattern in shell script 
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
* * * *
* * *
* *

Ans:
# Loop for the numbers pattern
for ((i = 1; i <= 4; i++)); do
    for ((j = 1; j <= i; j++)); do
        echo -n "$j "
    done
    echo
done

# Loop for the asterisks pattern
for ((i = 4; i >= 1; i--)); do
    for ((j = 1; j <= i; j++)); do
        echo -n "* "
    done
    echo
done
